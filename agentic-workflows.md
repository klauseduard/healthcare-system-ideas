# Opportunities and Risks of LLM-Based Agentic Workflows in Healthcare Information Systems

> **Note to readers:** This document explores both current and potential future applications of MCP (or agent-tooling protocols in general) in healthcare. Some advanced use cases describe theoretical possibilities rather than currently realistic solutions. The examples aim to illustrate the direction of development.

## Executive Summary

The integration of large language model (LLM)-based agentic workflows holds promise for revolutionizing healthcare information systems. These advanced systems offer the potential to enhance clinical decision-making, automate a wide range of administrative and operational tasks, improve patient experiences, and accelerate medical research. However, this potentially transformative technology also presents considerable risks, particularly concerning the privacy and security of sensitive patient data, the potential for bias and inaccuracies in AI outputs, and the complex ethical and regulatory considerations that must be carefully navigated.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a potentially crucial enabling layer for these workflows, facilitating dynamic contextual adaptation and seamless interaction with existing IT infrastructure. This document explores both the opportunities and the inherent risks associated with adopting LLM-based agentic workflows within legacy healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for a balanced and strategic approach to implementation that prioritizes risk mitigation and ethical considerations to ensure a safe and effective integration.

## 1. Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture

> **Note:**  It's important to note that while this document explores MCP within healthcare contexts, the Model Context Protocol is fundamentally domain-agnostic. Developed as a universal standard for AI system integration, MCP's architecture and capabilities apply equally across industries ranging from finance and legal to manufacturing and customer service. The healthcare applications described here represent just one domain where MCP's featuresâ€”dynamic tool discovery, contextual adaptation, and standardized integration could provide significant value. The same architectural principles enable similar benefits in any sector requiring sophisticated AI orchestration and integration with existing systems.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in the way AI systems interact with healthcare environments. At its core, MCP is an open standard developed (by Anthropic, published on Nov 26th, 2024) to establish secure and standardized connections between AI assistants and the diverse systems where data resides, including content repositories, business tools, and internal databases.

### Dynamic Tool Discovery: A Key MCP Advantage

One of MCP's most powerful features is its ability to incorporate new tools without requiring modifications to the orchestrator itself. This "plug-and-play" architecture allows LLM agents to:

1. Dynamically discover available tools in the ecosystem
2. Select appropriate tools based on the current context and task requirements
3. Adapt to changes in the available toolset without reconfiguration

#### Example: Dynamic Tool Ecosystem in Clinical Decision Support

```
Scenario: A hospital adds a new pharmacogenomic analysis service to its IT ecosystem

Without MCP: The clinical decision support system would require manual updates, 
reconfiguration, and possibly redeployment to utilize the new service.

With MCP:
1. The new pharmacogenomic service is registered as an MCP server/connector
2. It publishes its capabilities and API via MCP's discovery mechanism
3. The LLM agent automatically discovers the new service during its next interaction
4. When encountering a medication decision that could benefit from pharmacogenomic insights:
   - The agent recognizes the relevance of the new tool
   - It invokes the pharmacogenomic service alongside existing tools
   - It incorporates the additional insights into its recommendations
5. No changes to the agent itself were required to utilize this new capability
```

#### Example: Adaptation to Tool Unavailability

```
Scenario: A clinical laboratory system temporarily goes offline during maintenance

Without MCP: Workflow interruption, manual workarounds needed, possible delays in care

With MCP:
1. Agent attempts to access laboratory data through the primary laboratory system
2. Upon detecting the system is unavailable, the agent:
   - Identifies alternative data sources (e.g., backup systems, cached data, summary reports)
   - Modifies its approach to use available tools and data
   - Transparently notes the limitations of the alternative approach in its output
   - Continues supporting the clinical workflow with best available information
3. When the primary system returns online, the agent automatically resumes using it
   without requiring intervention
```

This flexibility creates resilience in healthcare workflows, allowing continued operation even when specific tools or systems become unavailable.

### Risks of Dynamic Tool Orchestration

The flexibility of MCP-based agentic workflows introduces specific risks that must be addressed:

1. **Tool Selection Errors**: The agent might:
   - Fail to use an appropriate tool due to misunderstanding context
   - Select a less optimal tool when better ones are available
   - Miss critical tools required for comprehensive analysis

2. **Orchestration Sequence Issues**: 
   - Inefficient sequence of tool execution
   - Failure to properly chain tool outputs as inputs to subsequent tools
   - Inability to properly manage parallel vs. sequential tool execution

3. **Result Interpretation Challenges**:
   - Misinterpreting tool outputs or API responses
   - Failing to recognize when a tool produces incorrect results
   - Incorrectly combining information from multiple tools

4. **Transparency Limitations**:
   - Difficulty explaining which tools were used and why
   - Limited visibility into decision factors for tool selection
   - Challenges in auditing the complete tool chain

### Guardrails for Safe Tool Orchestration

To mitigate the risks associated with dynamic tool orchestration, several guardrails can be implemented:

1. **Mandatory Tool Verification**:
   - Critical healthcare functions maintain a list of required tools that must be used
   - Verification steps ensure all necessary tools were considered
   - Alerts when essential tools are skipped or unavailable

2. **Tool Chain Validation**:
   - Pre-defined patterns for common clinical workflows
   - Validation of tool execution sequences against best practices
   - Detection of unusual or potentially problematic tool combinations

3. **Expert Oversight Mechanisms**:
   - Clear highlighting of which tools were used in generating outputs
   - Confidence scores for tool selection decisions
   - Human review requirements for novel tool chains

4. **Execution Monitoring**:
   - Logging of all tool selections, executions, and outputs
   - Runtime monitoring for unexpected tool behavior
   - Circuit breakers for tools that consistently produce errors

5. **Graceful Degradation Protocols**:
   - Clearly defined fallback procedures when optimal tools are unavailable
   - Explicit communication of limitations when using alternative approaches
   - Appropriate escalation to human operators when tool limitations exceed acceptable thresholds

## 2. MCP Dynamic Tool Discovery and Orchestration

A fundamental advantage of MCP is its ability to facilitate dynamic tool discovery and orchestration, allowing healthcare LLM agents to adapt to evolving capabilities without system reconfiguration:

The LLM-based agentic workflow in healthcare follows a structured process that enables intelligent and autonomous operation within clinical environments:

1. **Input**: The system receives patient data from various sources, including EHRs, laboratory results, and imaging studies
2. **Planning**: The agent breaks down complex clinical tasks into manageable steps based on the context and user needs
3. **Tool Selection**: The appropriate tools and APIs are selected for accessing necessary resources, such as medical databases or SNOMED CT terminologies
4. **Execution**: The agent performs actions such as data analysis, pattern recognition, or clinical decision support
5. **Validation**: Results are verified against medical knowledge and validated for accuracy and reliability
6. **Output**: Clinical insights, recommendations, or automated documentation are generated for healthcare professionals
7. **Human Review**: Clinical oversight ensures that all AI-generated content is reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals

## 9. Current Limitations and Implementation Realities

While the potential of MCP and LLM-based agentic workflows in healthcare is compelling, several practical limitations should be acknowledged:

### Current MCP Implementation Limitations

- **Integration Complexity**: Existing healthcare systems often have limited API capabilities, making full MCP integration challenging without significant custom development
- **Authentication Standardization**: Healthcare systems use varying authentication mechanisms that may not easily adapt to MCP's authentication model
- **Workflow Autonomy**: Current implementations typically require significant human oversight and intervention rather than achieving full autonomy
- **Learning Curve**: Organizations need time and resources to develop expertise in effectively implementing and managing MCP-based systems

### Real-World Implementation Considerations

- **Start with Focused Use Cases**: Begin with narrow, well-defined applications like documentation assistance or basic information retrieval before progressing to more complex workflows
- **Phased Approach**: Implement in stages, starting with read-only capabilities before allowing systems to write back to healthcare databases
- **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine MCP with existing integration approaches rather than wholesale replacement
- **Regulatory Validation**: Plan for extensive validation processes, especially for clinical decision support functionalities

## 10. Conclusion: Towards an Intelligent and Responsible Healthcare Future

LLM-based agentic workflows hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare information systems, offering opportunities to enhance clinical decision-making, streamline operations, improve patient engagement, and accelerate medical research. This technology promises a future where intelligent agents can augment the capabilities of healthcare professionals, leading to greater efficiency, more personalized care, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.

However, the path towards this intelligent future requires careful navigation of significant challenges related to data privacy, bias, accuracy, transparency, and technical integration. A thoughtful and strategic approach to implementation, guided by strong ethical principles and robust risk management strategies, will be essential for healthcare organizations to responsibly harness the transformative power of these advanced AI systems.

By prioritizing patient safety, data security, and ethical considerations throughout the development and deployment process, the healthcare industry can work towards an AI-enabled future that truly benefits patients, providers, and the healthcare system as a whole.
